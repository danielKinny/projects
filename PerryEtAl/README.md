the program has a few functionalities which closely mirror the actual paradigm used in the study such as:
- distance calculation between protagonist and person.
- equal chance of each protagonist being selected (ball, authority, friend, stranger)
- 1s display of protagonist, followed by 0.5 second display of fixation point, followed by 1 second delay, followed by simulation running for ~3 seconds.
